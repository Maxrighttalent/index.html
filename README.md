## 1. Abstract

**USDtz (USDT.z)** is a next-generation, multi-collateral stablecoin built on **Ethereum**, designed to maintain a stable 1:1 peg to the US Dollar. Unlike traditional stablecoins, USDtz combines **transparent reserve architecture**, **on-chain governance**, and **upgradeable smart contracts** to ensure long-term resilience, decentralization, and trust.

USDtz is governed by its community through the **USDtz Controller**, a UUPS-upgradeable smart contract that allows secure, permissioned upgrades while preserving user balances and ecosystem integrity.

All code is open-source and hosted on GitHub:

## 3. Token Mechanics

### Minting & Burning
- **Mint Authority**: `MINTER_ROLE` (Treasury Multisig)
- **Burn Authority**: `BURNER_ROLE` (Staking contracts)
- **Daily Mint Limit**: 1% of total supply
- **Approval**: 3-of-5 multisig required

### Governance
- **Voting Power**: 1 USDT.z = 1 vote
- **Quorum**: 5% of total supply
- **Voting Period**: 72 hours
- **Platform**: [Snapshot ‚Äì `usdtz.eth`](https://snapshot.org/#/usdtz.eth)

### Fee Distribution
| Allocation | Use Case |
|----------|--------|
| 70% | Reserve Fund (stability buffer) |
| 20% | Stakers (yield) |
| 10% | Treasury (operations) |

## 4. Reserve Architecture

### Collateral Strategy
The protocol uses a **phased collateral model**:

| Phase | Strategy | Assets |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | 1:1 Fiat-Backed | USDC, GUSD |
| **Phase 2** | 1.5:1 Over-Collateralized | USDC + stETH |
| **Phase 3** | 2:1 Dynamic | USDC, stETH, tokenized bonds |

### Benefits of Over-Collateralization
- üõ°Ô∏è **Stability**: Extra collateral absorbs market shocks
- üîÑ **Trustless Redemption**: Users can always redeem at par
- üìà **Scalability**: Enables higher borrowing limits

### Reserve Flow

5. User Operations
Minting Process
An authorized minter deposits USD-equivalent collateral (e.g., 1,000 USDC) into a unique deposit address.
The deposit is verified and swept into the main reserve wallet.
Upon confirmation, 1,000 USDT.z are minted and sent to the minter‚Äôs wallet.
Redemption Process
A user burns USDT.z via the redemption portal.
The system verifies the burn and triggers a withdrawal.
The equivalent value in USDC (minus a 0.1% fee) is sent to the user.
üîê All operations are subject to multisig approval and daily limits. 

6. Token Utility
